* Models:

* User: Uses Devise for authentication, handling sign-ups and logins. Itâ€™s connected to posts and likes.
* Post: Includes title and content, and is linked to the user. It also supports liking functionality.
* Like: Allows users to like posts and can be associated with different models thanks to its polymorphic setup.
* Routes:
* Devise manages user authentication.
* CRUD operations for posts are set up, and a simple route for creating likes.

* Turbo Frames make the like button and like counts update in real-time without refreshing the page.
* Keeping Like button and likes count in a partial for DRY.
* Testing Gems:
* RSpec: For writing and running tests.
* Factory Bot: For creating test data.
* Shoulda Matchers: For simplifying tests on validations and associations.
